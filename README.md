# Catastrophic-Warning
notice by internet imminent natural disaster 
6 essential apps to have on your phone for when natural disasters strike
MY PROJECT ATTEMPT IS TO PROVIDE A WARNING FOR CATASTROFE ALERT, Japan type ... 1 0 seconds for earthquake ...... and it works, the problem comes where that system is not implemented, you know, rich and poor countries ... 2nd problem: The signs are not synchronized: Radio --- TeleVision --- DTT ---- Internet --- Mobile Phone ---- I give a Nobel Prize to anyone who can synchronize it this year ... Solution: We all manage the Internet, or there is someone nearby, if it were possible to agree, without being scared by this, to provide an EMERGING NOTICE IN THE BROWSERS (all, please), do not think too much, because the application starts alone, if not that it is to be thankful, so give time to be safe, and if it does not affect you, and you are next, you are advancing on the issue of sending humanitarian aid (every hour is crucial for many lives), and even if you are at the antipodes , with these planes, you arrive too
